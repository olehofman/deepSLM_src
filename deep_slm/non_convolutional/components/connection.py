class Connection(object):
    """Class representing the connection between two neurons in a neural network.

    Parameters
    ----------
    from_neuron : InputNeuron or HiddenNeuron
        Neuron to be set as origin of the connection.

    to_neuron : HiddenNeuron or OutputNeuron
        Neuron to be set as destination of the connection by adding from_neuron to
        its collection of input connections.

    weight : float
        Value of the connection.

    is_active : bool
        Flag that indicates if this connection is being considered in the neural network.
        If True, it indicates that this connection should be considered when computing
        semantics for the to_neuron.

    Attributes
    ----------
        from_neuron: InputNeuron or HiddenNeuron
            Origin of the connection.

        weight: float
            Weight's value of the connection.

        is_active: bool
            Flag that indicates if this connection is being considered in the neural network.

        is_from_previous_layer : bool
            Flag that indicates if this connection is set between two consecutive layers.
